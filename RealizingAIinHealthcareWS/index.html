			<p>The goal of this two-day workshop is to explore the role of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in enabling the implementation of AI in real-world healthcare. Drawing on fieldwork and case studies, we will reflect on key concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI), including "explainability", "trust", and "accuracy", to support researchers and developers in taking a more sociotechnical and human-centered perspective, when working to bring AI systems to change care delivery.</p>
						
			<p>The background for this workshop is the limited uptake of AI in healthcare. The last several years have shown a strong growth of AI technologies with promising results for many areas of healthcare. HCI has contributed to these discussions, mainly with studies on explainability of advanced algorithms. However, there are only few AI-systems based on machine learning algorithms that make it to the real world and everyday care. This challenging move has been named the "last mile" of AI in healthcare, emphasizing the sociotechnical uncertainties and unforeseen learnings from involving users in the design or use of AI-based systems. With this workshop we aim to set the stage for a new wave of HCI research that accounts for and begins to develop new insights, concepts, and methods, for going the "last mile" with AI in healthcare.</p>

			Prospective participants are invited to submit a 2-4 pages position paper using the EUSSET template (available as <a href="https://ecscw.eusset.eu/2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ecscw-2019-EP-template.zip">Latex</a>, <a href="https://ecscw.eusset.eu/2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ECSCW-2019_EP-template.doc">MS Word</a>, or <a href="https://ecscw.eusset.eu/2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ECSCW-2019_EP-template.rtf">RTF</a>). <strong>Accepted contributions will be published as part of a technical report from one of the organizers’ institutions or at Zenodo</strong>. Submissions should be sent to: <strong><a href="mailto:ecscw2019.carenetworksworkshop@gmail.com">ecscw2019.carenetworksworkshop@gmail.com</a></strong> by <strong> April 15th 2019.</strong></p>

			<p>We expect position papers that describe or discuss collaborative care situations that are better understood in terms of care networks, including: case studies or reports on recent experiments or prototypes, ethnographic fieldwork or qualitative studies, theoretical accounts, and critical reflections. Authors can make contributions that discuss issues relevant to the design, development, or use of technologies for care, or impacts of technology use on care. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Who/what cares or is involved in care?</li>
				<li>How do different actors of a care network engage in care?</li>
				<li>What tensions exist in care networks? </li>
				<li>How are different perspectives integrated and negotiated?</li>
				<li>How is the care network structured?</li>
				<li>How do actors manage the multidirectional nature of care?</li>
				<li>To what extent are care networks (de)centralized?</li>
				<li>Does focusing on care networks change how we conceptualize care?</li>
				<li>How to design for care networks?</li>
				<li>How to incorporate different perspectives in design?</li> 
				<li>How to enable collaborative decision making for care networks?</li>
				<li>What are methodological approaches or challenges to studying care networks?</li>
				<li>What else has been examined around care networks in the CSCW community?</li>
			</ul>
