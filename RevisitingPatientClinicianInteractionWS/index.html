			<p>The goal of this workshop is to revisit the concept of patient-clinician interaction, a classical concept of CSCW research in healthcare. While the CSCW community has been working on patient-clinician interaction for decades, the last years have seen a number of changes to care provision, motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the strong uptake of remote care technologies, or the introduction of patient-generated data technologies. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare also promise to impact patient-clinician interactions as we know them. In this context, the workshop will engage in participatory discussions to take stock, analyse challenges from the field, reflect on opportunities for technologies, and craft future research agendas for CSCW in healthcare.</p>
						
			<p>The workshop will promote a participatory design approach involving researchers, patients, and clinicians. While researchers will present their position papers at the start of the workshop, all participants will be encouraged to discuss the position papers. In the second part of the workshop, researchers will engage with patients, to discuss their experiences and practical challenges while using or interacting with healthcare services, and with clinicians, to discuss their experiences and challenges in patient-monitoring, adding other layers to the discussions on patient-clinician interactions.</p>

			<h5>Contributing</h5>
			
			
			
			<p>We encourage submissions from researchers, engineers, designers, data scientists, social scientists, clinicians, and patients, who are interested in the workshop topic. Position papers can describe or discuss case studies, experiments, prototypes, ethnographic fieldwork or qualitative studies, theoretical accounts, literature reviews, and critical reflections. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Technology-supported patient-clinician interaction during COVID-19;</li>
				<li>Patient-generated data and patient-clinician interaction;</li>
				<li>AI-in-the-loop within patient-clinician interaction;</li>
				
				<li>Intended and unintended consequences of technology-supported patient-clinician interaction, including emotional work, and other types of invisible labour;</li>
				
				<li>Ethical considerations in technology-supported patient-clinician interaction;</li>
				<li>Patient-led research and its contributions to technology-supported patient-clinician interaction.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Prospective participants are invited to submit a 4 page position paper in the ECSCW format (templates available for <a href="https://ecscw.eusset.eu/2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ECSCW-2022_Template.zip">Latex</a> and <a href="https://ecscw.eusset.eu/2022/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ECSCW-2022_Template_.doc">MS Word</a>) - references are excluded from page count. Submissions should be sent to: <strong><a href="mailto:francisco.nunes@fraunhofer.pt">francisco.nunes AT fraunhofer.pt</a></strong> by <strong> April 15th 2022.</strong></p>
			
			<p>Authors of accepted position papers will prepare 5-minute videos that will be shared on the website of the workshop to help participants starting to reflect about the topic before the workshop takes place. At the workshop, participants will deliver presentations on their work.</p> 
			
			<p>Accepted position papers will be made available on the Workshop's website.</p>
